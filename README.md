## My projects:

Here are available the notebooks of the projects made by me in the area of Data Science and Machine Learning.

* **[Google Play Store Analysis:](https://github.com/luislauriano/Data_Science/tree/master/Possiveis%20resultados%20copa%20do%20mundo%202022)**
This is a project for the purposes of curiosity and machine learning study, with the aim of developing a model capable of predicting possible outcomes of the 2022 World Cup matches, until reaching the result of the grand winner of the championship. &nbsp; &nbsp; [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/diogo-costa-silva/Data-Science/blob/main/notebooks/titanic_analysis.ipynb)


* **[MotoGP World Championships from 1949 to 2021:](https://github.com/luislauriano/Data_Science/tree/master/Prevendo%20Partidas%20de%20League%20of%20Legends)**
This Machine Learning project, defined as an end-to-end project, aimed to go from collecting match data to building a machine learning model, to predict the chances of the team that is playing on the blue side. on the side of the map win. Performing steps such as: Pre-processing and data analysis, dimensionality reduction and selection of variables, and construction of both a model completed with XGBClassifier, and construction of a logistic regression model from the results obtained from AutoML with Pycaret.

* **[NYC AirBnB Open Data from 2019:](https://github.com/luislauriano/Data_Science/tree/master/Spotify%20%26%20Python%20%26%20Data%20Science)**
The objective of the project was to perform a data analysis of the Spotify albums by the artist NexoAnexo, going through the main steps of a data analysis. Being, data collection, pre-processing, exploration and visualization of the data. Finally, after the analysis was completed, an application/dashboard was built with Python and the application was made available on the web through heroku. Another objective is that from the conclusions made from the analysis of the data of the songs of the albums, factors that help or contribute to an album or song to be more successful and how this can be used in future releases could be identified.

* **[U.S.A. AirBnB Open Data from 2020 and 2023:](https://github.com/luislauriano/Data_Science/tree/master/Possiveis%20resultados%20copa%20do%20mundo%202022)**
This is a project for the purposes of curiosity and machine learning study, with the aim of developing a model capable of predicting possible outcomes of the 2022 World Cup matches, until reaching the result of the grand winner of the championship.

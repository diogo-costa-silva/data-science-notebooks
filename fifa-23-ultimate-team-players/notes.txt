I've already done some data understading and I identified some things that need to be addressed:
- The "Price_Variation" has % in its values and it should be a float
- "Pace / Diving" is float but the ret of the stats are int. Also, these type of column name should be changed like "Shooting / Handling" to "Shooting_Handling".
- The "Height" column has heights in both centimeters and inches. Create two new columns with the correct data type.
- The "BodyType" column has a lot of different values and some of them have the weight attached to them. Some of those values like "CR7" or "Messi" should be discarded because they don't make sense as a type of body of an athlete.

address these concerns in order to begin the exploratory data analysis of this dataset.
